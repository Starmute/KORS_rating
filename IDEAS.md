**Some possible ideas for KORS metrics.**

- Commits per month

- Completeness (true/false: does the project do its job already?)

- Number of developers

- Tx/s scaling capability

- Prunability

- Degree of adoption (how many businesses accept it?)

- Degree of node decentralization (how many nodes are active?)

- Privacy capabilities (boolean)

And a few qualitative:

- Breadth of use case

- Credentials of developers

- Development decentralization (is anyone allowed to be a developer? is it structured as a corporation? does the system inherently fund development, or is it funded by donations?)

- Privacy strength (how much is hidden for private transactions? is privacy mandatory?)

- Degree of scripting capability (none, basic, or turing complete?)

- Technicality/detail of whitepaper

- User-friendliness (how many wallets are available, for what plaforms, and how easy are they to use?)

- Security (is there a trusted setup? are hardware wallets available? what kind of consensus system (PoW>others in terms of security))

- Degree of censorship-resistance (what would a state-level entity have to do to shut it down?)
