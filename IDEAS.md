**Some possible ideas for KORS metrics.**

"Quantitative":

- Commits per month

- Completeness (true/false: does the project do its job already?)

- Number of developers

- Tx/s scaling capability

- Prunability

- Current tx/day

- Current number of wallets (if knowable)

- Coin distribution (if knowable)

- Degree of adoption (how many businesses accept it?)

- Degree of node decentralization (how many nodes are active?)

- Privacy capabilities (boolean)

"Qualitative" (we can probably convert these into objective parameters):

- Breadth of use case

- Credentials of developers

- Development decentralization (is anyone allowed to be a developer? is it structured as a corporation? does the system inherently fund development, or is it funded by donations?)

- Privacy strength (how much is hidden for private transactions? is privacy mandatory?)

- Degree of scripting capability (none, basic, or turing complete?)

- Technicality/detail of whitepaper

- User-friendliness (how many wallets are available, for what plaforms, and how easy are they to use?)

- Security (is there a trusted setup? are hardware wallets available? what kind of consensus system (PoW>others in terms of security))

- Degree of censorship-resistance (what would a state-level entity have to do to shut it down?)

Ideas from YLoponom:

- charts (like cmc, but ranked by KORS)
- growth # of wallets/users per week/month/year and trend (if known) <-  like cmc instead of 1h/24h/7d
- number of used wallets per week/month/year (if known)
- available use cases (big brands/partnerships = 10, small/large onlineshops = 1-10, darknet = 5, debit credit cards = 5)?
- distribution of a coin - if known (mostly wales and/or large wallets = 0) 
- future outlook and plans / exclusive use-cases / roadmap (team delivers promises?)
- official mobile and/or web wallets 
- easy to use/buy/spend (specially for women and non-tech ppl)
- volatility
- brand / age / publicity / "ceo"
- launch type: not sold out ico - 2.5
- marketing
- sort by type (currency, contracts/platform, app, infrastructure, ponzi = -10, ...)
