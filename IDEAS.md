**Some possible ideas for KORS metrics.**

"Quantitative":

- Commits per month

- Completeness (true/false: does the project do its job already?)

- Number of developers

- Tx/s scaling capability

- Prunability

- Current tx/day

- Current number of wallets (if knowable)

- Coin distribution (if knowable)

- Degree of adoption (how many businesses accept it?)

- Degree of node decentralization (how many nodes are active?)

- Privacy capabilities (boolean)

"Qualitative" (we can probably convert these into objective parameters):

- Breadth of use case

- Credentials of developers

- Development decentralization (is anyone allowed to be a developer? is it structured as a corporation? does the system inherently fund development, or is it funded by donations?)

- Privacy strength (how much is hidden for private transactions? is privacy mandatory?)

- Degree of scripting capability (none, basic, or turing complete?)

- Technicality/detail of whitepaper

- User-friendliness (how many wallets are available, for what plaforms, and how easy are they to use?)

- Security (is there a trusted setup? are hardware wallets available? what kind of consensus system (PoW>others in terms of security))

- Degree of censorship-resistance (what would a state-level entity have to do to shut it down?)

Ideas from YLoponom:

- charts (like cmc, but ranked by KORS)
- growth # of wallets/users per week/month/year and trend (if known) <-  like cmc instead of 1h/24h/7d
- number of used wallets per week/month/year (if known)
- available use cases (big brands/partnerships = 10, small/large onlineshops = 1-10, darknet = 5, debit credit cards = 5)?
- distribution of a coin - if known (mostly whales and/or large wallets = 0) 
- future outlook and plans / exclusive use-cases / roadmap (team delivers promises?)
- official mobile and/or web wallets 
- easy to use/buy/spend (specially for women and non-tech ppl)
- volatility
- brand / age / publicity / "ceo"
- launch type: not sold out ico - 2.5
- marketing
- sort by type (currency, contracts/platform, app, infrastructure, ponzi = -10, ...)
- rating+ranking by score and additionally/optionally a fairly calculated pricerange would be interesting imo - ex.: price of trx is not fundamental, value is zero atm -> so everybody and specially noobs can choose on its own if a crypto is worth buy/hodl or better sell (because of many reasons like overrating, undervalued, hype, etc.)
- listed on small/large exchange(s) = decentral (0-1), central (0-1) and if crypto can be bought directly via fiat/credit card (y/n 1/0)
- competition (how much cryptos already exists in this category/with this idea): 1 - 10
- currency rating = already accepted as currency in some countries by gov/ppl?
- risks (easy to attack, already hacked in the past, legal reasons, etc.)



advantages KORS-ranking:
- no pump & dump / no manipulation
- real market value (not all in one boat -> not just one (btc) as leading currency
- cryptos can be compared by category
- fair, easy to understand and transparent
- ppl do not look just at price and are getting informed, how value (!) of "their" coins is generated

disadvantages cmc:
- ranking only by mcap (cryptos/projekts only get attention when price has already grown or is a top 100 crypto - next to scams/ponzis)
- manipulation (ex.: korean exchanges/prices were excluded without warning)
- no warnings and indirect ad scams/ponzis -> ex.: "wow, bitconnect is ranked in top 10" = must be legit
- danger of confusion/brand name misuse -> ex.: "wow, bitcoin gold/cash is top 20" -> looks cheap, sounds good, high ranked
- listed price = ex.: 1 bitcoin and not 1 satoshi (noobs: "1 whole bitcoin is too expensive, will buy cheaper coins = feels more")
- total mcap = how much fiatmoney is really into crypto? nobody really knows - except theter (if its backed 100% by dollar)
- mcap = unrealistic circulation supply (ex.: millions of bitcoins are lost and are included as available)
